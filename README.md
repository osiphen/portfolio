# Cody's Portfolio
<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! In lieu of a traditional portfolio, I've decided to include some projects that I've worked on/am actively working on. The items featured demonstrate a mixture of my skills as all of these sites utilize HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. Often this is completely custom code, but I have dabbled within frameworks such as React and Vue.</p>
