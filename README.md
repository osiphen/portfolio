# Cody's Portfolio
<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! In lieu of a traditional portfolio, I've decided to include some projects that I've worked on/am actively working on. If I'm featuring these items, there has been a significant enough amount of work completed by myself, whether solo or in a team setting.</p>
